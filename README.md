# Teaching Static Web Development with NFC Technology
## About
This project encourages students to design digital business cards that showcase their academic courses, personal information, work or project experiences, goals, and social media profiles. By using NFC (Near Field Communication) technology
## Description
  * Difficulty Level: Easy
  * Target Audience: 6th Grade - College
  * Duration of Workshop: 30-60 mins
  * Needed Material: NFC Chip, Mobile App capable of reading and writing to NFC Chip
  * The primary goal of this project is educating others about static web development by creating a digital business card using NFC technology
  * This project involves students creating digital business cards containing information about their academic courses, personal details, work or project experiences, goals, and preferred social media platforms for sharing. The technology employed includes the use of NFC chips to facilitate easy sharing of these digital cards. The result is a convenient and innovative method for students to network and share their professional and personal information with others they encounter. The target audience are students seeking to enhance their networking capabilities and digital presence.
